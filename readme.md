### Stomping Grounds: A Biographical Storymap of Places I've Lived and Their Backyards

â€‹	This story map geovisualization takes the reader on a journey through the places I've lived and the beautiful areas that surround those places. Each location is briefly described by the town I lived in and an outdoor recreation area nearby. Scattered throughout the scenes are clickable markers that show photos that I've taken in that region.
