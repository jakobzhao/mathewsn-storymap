### A Biographical Storymap: The Places I've Lived and Their Backyards

â€‹	This geovisualization is a story map, giving the reader a tour through the places that I have lived. Each location is briefly described by the town I lived in and an outdoor recreation area nearby. Scattered throughout the scenes are clickable markers and polygons that show photos and give descriptions of each area.
